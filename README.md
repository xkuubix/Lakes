# Lake Temperature Data Visualization

This project involves the following tasks:
- Loading lake temperature data from an Excel file.
- Parsing stations for water bodies.
- Integrating additional lake data using the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/).
- Visualizing temperature variations using R (with ink maximization rule).

## Tools Used
- **R** for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Nominatim API** for retrieving lake-related information.
